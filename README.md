# Covid Prediction
This is a research paper with a final website implementing a Neural Network to predict whether a patient has COVID-19 or not based on his medical report of previous diseases and other info.

## Folders 
Inside each folder, there is a **report** explaining everything. Enjoy Reading :)

## Usage
Due to the lack of financial resources, the web application has not been hosted on the web, yet. In order to try the website on your local host you will need to run the following commands in your terminal.
```sh
cd "5. Model & Utility Application Implementation\covid_prediction"
python manage.py runserver
```

Then, ctrl + click the link appearing in the terminal to navigate to the website frontend and try the final utility application.

**Note:** This website is built using Django, so if you do not have it, you will need to run the following command in your terminal.
```sh
pip install Django
```

Moreover, you will need to _pip install_ all the Python libraries required.
